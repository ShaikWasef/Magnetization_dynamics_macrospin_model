# Magnetization_dynamics_macrospin_model
This file includes a plug and play macrospin model which can be used in any verilog ams simulator (Ex. Cadence Virtuoso) . The model includes magnetization dynamics of a ferromagnet under the effect of an effective field , spin transfer torque and spin orbit torque . The model also includes the field like torque and damping like torque components of each spin torque.
